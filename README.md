# Verification-of-Perceptron-Convergence-Theorem-

This repository contains the implementation and report for the project **"Experimental Verification of the Perceptron Convergence Algorithm"** done as part of the CS725 – Foundations of Machine Learning course at IIT Bombay.

The project verifies the **Perceptron Convergence Theorem** using synthetic 2D datasets. It includes:
- Perceptron implementation from scratch  
- Experiments on separable and non-separable data  
- Comparison of actual updates vs. theoretical mistake bound  
- Visualizations of decision boundary evolution  

## Files
- `Project_Report.pdf` – Complete report  
- `src/` – Code for data generation, perceptron training, and visualization  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebook for running experiments
